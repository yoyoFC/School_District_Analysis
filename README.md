# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is provide statistics metrics based on the state-testing results. The raw data containswas presented in two tables:

1. School data : School type, size, budget. 
2. Student data: Student ID, name, gender , grade , school name , reading and math scores.

After the first statistic results, the board notified about evidence of academic dishonesty in one school. We decided remove the data related to the school involved in this issue. 

## Results
In order to explain the new results obtained, we are going to addresses a group of questions as bullet points. For an additional precision during the analysis, all the numeric results were rounded to the nearest 10th. Always the original metric parameters (screenshots) will be displayed before the new results. 

1. How is the district summary affected?: The values from the original results and the new one are very similar. Probably, the only value affected is the >OveralL Passing percentage, which decrease in 0.3%
